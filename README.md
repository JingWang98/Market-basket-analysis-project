# Market-basket-analysis-project
For the Algorithms for Massive Data exam, we are asked to implement a system finding frequent itemsets (aka market-basket analysis), analyzing the LinkedIn Jobs & Skills dataset, downloadable using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024.
The detector must consider as baskets the strings contained in the job_skills column of the  job_skills.csv file, using skills as items.
